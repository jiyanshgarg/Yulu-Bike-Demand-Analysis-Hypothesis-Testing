# ***Yulu Bike Demand Analysis & Hypothesis Testing***

## **Project Overview**

Yulu is India’s leading micro-mobility service provider, offering shared electric cycles for short-distance urban travel. Recently, Yulu experienced a decline in revenue, signaling a potential shift in demand patterns.

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing on Yulu’s historical rental data to identify the key factors influencing bike rental demand and to derive actionable business insights.

## **Business Problem**

Yulu wants to understand:

1. Which variables significantly influence electric cycle demand?

2. Does demand differ on working days vs non-working days?

3. How do season and weather conditions impact rentals?

4. Are weather conditions dependent on seasons?

5. How can these insights help improve revenue and operational efficiency?

### **Tools & Technologies**

- Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, StatsModels

- Statistical Methods:

  - Independent t-test

  - ANOVA

  - Kruskal-Wallis test

  - Chi-Square test

  - Shapiro-Wilk & Levene’s tests
 
## **Key Business Insights**

- Seasonality and weather are the strongest drivers of demand.

- Fall and Summer record the highest bike rentals.

- Clear weather leads to maximum usage, while rain/snow suppresses demand.

- Working days and holidays do not significantly change average demand — indicating Yulu is used for general urban mobility, not just office commuting.

- Peak demand consistently occurs during 7–9 AM and 5–7 PM, aligning with commute hours.

## **Business Recommendations**

- Implement weather-aware demand forecasting for fleet optimization

- Increase bike availability during high-demand seasons (Summer & Fall)

- Focus operational planning on peak hours, not just day type

- Avoid reducing fleet size on holidays

- Introduce weather-based promotions and off-season incentives

- Improve data collection for extreme weather scenarios

- Leverage sustainability-focused campaigns for brand growth
